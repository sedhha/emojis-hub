## Getting Started

Install Dependencies or code files:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sedhha/emojis-hub
cd emojis-hub
yarn
# or
npm install
```

Please note that I am using `yarn` instead of `npm` or `pnpm`. In order to ensure same packages are used, I would highly recomment using `yarn` instead of `npm`.

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Other Projects

I have intentionally added a footer which is showcase of all my other projects. However it could easily be removed by clicking on `close this` button:

![Remove the Image Icon](/src/readme-assets/remove-image.png)

In case you want to re-view the footer, you can add this to end of your web URL:
`?showOtherProjects=1`

For example: `http://localhost:3000/?showOtherProjects=1`
